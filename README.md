# Student Enrollment System

A full-stack student enrollment web application built with .NET 8 Clean Architecture backend and Angular 17 frontend.

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: .NET 8 Web API (Clean Architecture)
- **Frontend**: Angular 17 (Standalone Components, Lazy Loading)
- **Database**: SQL Server (EF Core 8)
- **Auth**: JWT Bearer Tokens
- **Cache**: Redis (StackExchange.Redis)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Modular Monolith over Microservices
For a university enrollment system of this scale, a modular monolith provides simpler deployment, easier transactions (critical for enrollment concurrency), and lower operational overhead. The Clean Architecture layers (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API) enforce strong separation of concerns without the network latency and distributed transaction complexity of microservices. If scale demands it later, each bounded context (Auth, Enrollment, Subjects) can be extracted independently.

### Why Pessimistic Locking (UPDLOCK) for Enrollment Concurrency
Enrollment has a strict capacity constraint (MaxCapacity = 30). With optimistic locking, two students could both read "29/30 enrolled" and both attempt to insert, exceeding capacity. `UPDLOCK + ROWLOCK` in `sp_EnrollStudent` acquires an exclusive lock on the subject row during the check-then-insert operation, guaranteeing serialized access. The performance cost is acceptable given enrollment windows are time-bounded and high-contention is short-lived.

### Why Stored Procedures Only for Critical Operations
`sp_EnrollStudent` encapsulates all business rule checks (3-subject limit, duplicate professor, capacity) and the insert in a single atomic transaction with pessimistic locking — impossible to replicate safely with EF Core alone. `sp_GetClassmates` enforces the data privacy rule (only FirstName + LastName) at the database level. All standard CRUD (student registration, subject listing) uses EF Core for developer productivity and maintainability.

### Why JWT Bearer Tokens
Stateless authentication scales horizontally without shared session storage. The `studentId` claim is read server-side from the token — the client never passes it as a parameter, preventing IDOR attacks.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | ❌ | Register student account |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | ❌ | Returns JWT token |
| GET | `/api/subjects` | ✅ | List subjects with professor and available spots |
| POST | `/api/enrollments` | ✅ | Enroll in a subject (calls sp_EnrollStudent) |
| GET | `/api/enrollments/my` | ✅ | Current student's enrollments |
| GET | `/api/enrollments/classmates/{subjectId}` | ✅ | Classmates (FirstName + LastName only) |
| GET | `/api/students` | ✅ | List all students (public names only) |

## Security

- JWT tokens signed with HMAC-SHA256
- Passwords hashed with BCrypt (never plain text)
- Rate limiting: 10 requests/second per user (.NET 8 native RateLimiter)
- CORS configured for frontend origin only
- HTTPS redirect enforced
- FluentValidation on all Commands
- studentId always read from JWT claims, never from client parameters

## Business Rules

1. Maximum 3 subjects per student
2. Student cannot have two classes with the same professor
3. Student can only see classmates' FirstName + LastName (never email)
4. Passwords hashed with BCrypt
